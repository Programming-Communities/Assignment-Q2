# Assignment 02: Understanding Key API and Software Concepts  

**Submitted By:** Hassan Ali Khan  

**Date:** 21 December 2024  

---

## Objective  

This assignment helps us understand basic ideas about APIs, SDKs, and some software terms, so we can use them in real-world programming.  

---

## Topics Explained  

Here's a detailed explanation of the terms, simplified to be easily understood by anyone:

---

### **API (Application Programming Interface)**  
An API is a way for two software programs to communicate with each other. Think of it like a waiter in a restaurant:  
- **Example:** If you use a weather app, the app uses an API to get weather data from a server and show it to you.  
- **Purpose:** APIs allow developers to access specific functions or data without needing to understand the whole system behind it.

---

### **SDK (Software Development Kit)**  
An SDK is a collection of tools, code samples, and instructions that help developers create software for specific platforms or tasks.  
- **Example:** If you want to create an Android app, the Android SDK provides all the tools you need to design, code, and test your app.  
- **Purpose:** It saves time by giving developers everything they need to start building software without creating tools from scratch.

---

### **Web APIs**  
Web APIs are APIs that work over the internet, allowing applications to send and receive data.  
- **Example:** When you search for a location in Google Maps, your browser or app uses a Web API to get the map and directions from Google’s servers.  
- **How it Works:** Web APIs often use HTTP (the same protocol that websites use) to exchange information.  
- **Purpose:** They make it easy for apps and websites to integrate with online services.

---

### **Library APIs**  
Library APIs provide pre-written functions or methods in a programming library that developers can use in their code.  
- **Example:** In Python, the `math` library has APIs like `sqrt()` to calculate the square root of a number. Instead of writing your own square root function, you can use the one from the library.  
- **Purpose:** Libraries save time by offering solutions for common programming tasks.

---

### **Prompting and Completion**  
This is a concept used in AI tools like ChatGPT, where:  
- **Prompting** means giving a command or question to the AI, telling it what you want.  
  - **Example:** “Write a short story about a dog.”  
- **Completion** is how the AI responds or fulfills your request.  
  - **Example:** The AI generates a story about a dog based on your input.  
- **Purpose:** Prompting and completion help humans interact with AI to get meaningful and useful results.
